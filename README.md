# Atom's rice

Using this configuration on my MacBook Pro mid 2012 running Arch/MacOS, Acer Chromebook with GalliumOS, Raspberry Pi 3B with DietPi.
Using scripts written in bash to keep things automated.
Making backup before replacing with symbolic link or replace symlink if relaunching script.


### Compatibility
script.sh works on:
* MacOS High Sierra (tested script.sh)
* [Arch](https://i.imgur.com/gjNNJV1.png) (Not tested script.sh) 
* Debian Based - only if you got all dependencies built and installed (Not tested)

### TODO
* More automation
* Bug fixes

### Inspirations
* [/r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) for theme, walls and stuff.
* [caarlos0 dotfiles](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles) for script.sh.
